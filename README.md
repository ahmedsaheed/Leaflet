Leaflet, a <b>minimal distractionless markdown editor</b> designed to quickly navigate between multiple `.md` files in a directory and its sub directories. It features a clean mathematical typesetting, chemical equation rendering, code blocks highlighting, writing statistics and a speed-reader.


I created this <a href="http://github.com/ahmedsaheed/Leaflet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="external ">application</a> to help me cope with note taking during school lectures as most of my lecturers spoke too fast. This application is made available as a free and <a href="https://github.com/ahmedsaheed/Leaflet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="external ">open source</a> software.

## Features

- **üñã Editing**: Switch between editing and preview mode seemlessly

- **‚öõÔ∏è Maths & Chemical Equation Typesetting**: Leaflet renders mathematical, physics and chemical equation out of the box.

- **üìÑ Uses Files**: Leaflet works with users file system directly instead of an external database.

- **üåô Dark / Light Mode**: Supports your system specified theme.

- **‚ú® Simplicity**: Leaflet focuses on simplicity and provides only necessary features needed.


- **üïâ Bidirectional Text**: Automatically detect BIDI - text and displays logiaclly.
